# Mood Detection and Management using Facial Expression (Big-Data-Analytics-Project-2018)

# Abstract
The core idea of our project is to classify a person's mood using his facial expression and provide certain services based on the mood. The features include suggesting and playing a song as per the mood, suggesting movies and management tips to improve the mood. We have designed a web application that takes the input in the form of an image. This image can be fed to our model that detects the emotion and classifies the image either into happy, sad, anger, disgust or surprise. The moods of the person is tracked every day and an analysis chart could be given at the end of particular month. We trained our model using Shallow learning techniqies (Spark), Deep learning techniques (Softmax, CNN and Inception) and Clarifai Api and we noted down the accuracy values for each of them. Inception model gives us the best value for our design.

# INTRODUCTION
The project’s idea is to classify a person's mood using his facial expression and provide certain services based on the mood. let’s start with the basic features of our model. Firstly, they can analyze the mood of the person with the facial expression. The model can detect five different moods of the person. The classes can be divided based on the emotions happiness, sadness, anger, surprise and disgust. Based on the facial expression the model predicts the emotion that would be useful further in the application. Secondly, it gives some suggestions based on the current emotion like songs, movies etc. On the user’s profile in the website, he/she can have access to a lot of information that is sorted in detail. They include:
